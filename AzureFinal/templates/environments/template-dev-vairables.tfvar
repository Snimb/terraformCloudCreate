## Compute size of the database change it to reflect the SKU name of the PostgreSQL database
cpu_cores       = 8  # Options include: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. 32, 48, 64, 96 etc.
total_memory_gb = 32 # options include: 8, 16, 24, 32 etc.
## Note: Ensure that the values for cpu_cores and total_memory_mb align with the specifications of the SKU you choose for your PostgreSQL Flexible Server. The SKU's name indicates the tier, CPU, and memory configuration. Adjust these variables accordingly to reflect your chosen SKU's resources accurately.

### PostgreSQL ###
database_names = ["db1", "db2"]
psql_sku_name  = "GP_Standard_D8ds_v5" # "B_Standard_B1ms" # Options include: B_Standard_B1ms, GP_Standard_D2s_v3, MO_Standard_E4s_v3 etc.
## The SKU name format generally follows the pattern "{Tier}_{Family}_{Size}", where:
## - {Tier} could be "B" (Basic), "GP" (General Purpose), or "MO" (Memory Optimized).
## - {Family} indicates the VM family, such as "Standard".
## - {Size} indicates the specific size within the tier and family, like "D2s_v3".
## It's important to select a SKU that matches your application's performance needs and budget. The chosen SKU impacts the server's performance characteristics, including CPU, memory, and I/O throughput.
## Remember: The availability of certain SKUs and their specifications can vary by Azure region and over time. Always refer to the official Azure documentation for the most current information on PostgreSQL Flexible Server SKUs, capabilities, and pricing.
