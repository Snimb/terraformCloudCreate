## Compute size of the database change it to reflect the SKU name of the PostgreSQL database
cpu_cores       = 1    # Options include: 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.
total_memory_mb = 2048 # Options include: 2048 ,4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.
## Note: Ensure that the values for cpu_cores and total_memory_mb align with the specifications of the SKU you choose for your PostgreSQL Flexible Server. The SKU's name indicates the tier, CPU, and memory configuration. Adjust these variables accordingly to reflect your chosen SKU's resources accurately.

### PostgreSQL ###
database_names = ["db1", "db2"]
psql_sku_name  = "B_Standard_B1ms" # Options include: B_Standard_B1ms, GP_Standard_D2s_v3, MO_Standard_E4s_v3 etc.
## The SKU name format generally follows the pattern "{Tier}_{Family}_{Size}", where:
## - {Tier} could be "B" (Basic), "GP" (General Purpose), or "MO" (Memory Optimized).
## - {Family} indicates the VM family, such as "Standard".
## - {Size} indicates the specific size within the tier and family, like "D2s_v3".
## It's important to select a SKU that matches your application's performance needs and budget. The chosen SKU impacts the server's performance characteristics, including CPU, memory, and I/O throughput.
## Remember: The availability of certain SKUs and their specifications can vary by Azure region and over time. Always refer to the official Azure documentation for the most current information on PostgreSQL Flexible Server SKUs, capabilities, and pricing.

### Log analytics ###
log_analytics_retention_days = 31 # Possible values are between 31 and 730
log_analytics_workspace_sku  = "PerGB2018"
## Other SKU options for Azure Log Analytics Workspace:
## "Free" - Offers limited data ingestion and retention capabilities. Suitable for small or trial environments.
## "PerGB2018" - Charges based on the volume of data ingested. Offers flexible data retention settings and access to all Log Analytics features. Recommended for most production environments.
## "Premium" - Offers the highest level of capabilities, including more extended data retention. Suitable for enterprises with extensive logging and monitoring needs.
## "CapacityReservation" - Provides a reserved capacity pricing model, offering cost savings for predictable logging volumes. Ideal for large-scale deployments where logging volume can be accurately predicted.
## "Standalone" - Allows for independent Log Analytics workspace usage without dependency on Azure Monitor. This SKU is designed for specific use cases where Log Analytics is used as a standalone service.
## Note: The availability and names of SKUs can change. Always refer to the official Azure documentation for the latest information on Log Analytics
